# eclipse_test_workspace
Useful default settings for a new Eclipse workspace (Kepler)

Eclipse tends to store a _lot_ of general settings in the workspace. Many of those are pretty irrelevant for using Eclipse efficiently. Some, however are essential

This is a collection of general settings that I found useful.

Use as is, or as a seed to create your own default settings.

NOTE:

For making changes, do the following:

1. Make sure your working copy is clean
2. Load workspace into Eclipse
3. Make desired changes to general settings etc.
4. Identify pertinent settings files and check in _only those_
5. Exit Eclipse
6. Delete everything in the workspace (except .git, of course!)
7. Reset hard (this will get rid of all the superfluous stuff)
